<p>Beauty is a real beast in THE REJUVENATOR (1988)! A mad scientist turns an aging b-movie starlet into a b-movie monster. It's like if THE FLY and SUNSET BLVD went into the machine from THE FLY.</p>

<p>Can the killer make-up make up for a lackluster story? Does out of sync audio add to the film experience? Is Jamie the real monster for watching this movie at 1.5x? Lights, camera, serum!</p>
