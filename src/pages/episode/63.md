To celebrate the release of a new D&D movie, we're revisiting the old D&D movie: DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS (2000). It takes everything you love about the tabletop roleplaying game and burns it to a crisp. With graphics out of a late 90's screensaver and too many scepters to count, this one is a sight to Beholder. But at least Jeremy Irons is there to chew the scenery. Roll initiative!
